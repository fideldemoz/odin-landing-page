Landing page project from The Odin Project  

## About this
This is a project, a type of self-assesmennt from The Odin Project, where I am learning Web Development.  

## Technologies
This is a very basic page where I just use html and css, most of the items on the page are laid out using flex layout.  

## About The Odin Project
The Odin Project (TOP) is a website where you can learn Web Development for free. What I like about TOP is their organized Full Stack curriculum, and the program is open sourced. You receive links to different great content on the internet. That's how I got to master CSS FLEX LAYOUT in just three days and I built this page.
I f you would like to know more about TOP, just search for "The Odin Project" on your preferred Search Engine.
